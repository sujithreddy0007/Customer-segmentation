# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project applies **KMeans clustering** to segment customers based on features like income and spending score. 

## 📁 Dataset
Used the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset with features like:
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

## 🔧 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Techniques Used
- KMeans clustering
- Elbow method to find optimal clusters
- Data preprocessing & scaling

## 📎 Output
Visual plots of clusters and customer groups.

## 🚀 How to Run
